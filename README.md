# Jobs
### Robust Fiber-Driven Task-Based Parallelism Library

## Features
- Fast scalable performance
- Lightweight dependencies with minimal switching overhead
- Managed dependency memory
- Unlimited dependencies per job, allowing for complex graphs
- High level algorithms to abstract individual job creation and management

## Motivation
With the modern trend of increasing CPU cores, a highly scalable automated work distribution system is fundamental as a backend for many real-time applications. While many of these already exist, few benefit from the power of user mode scheduling, which allows for minimal cost switching between jobs. The only other fiber backed job library at the time of conception (that I was aware of) was Richie Sam's Fiber Tasking Lib (FTL), which sadly lacked many crucial core and quality of life features which this project was created to satisfy.
